# Building-Notes-app-using-react
Hey guys!
I have tried to build a Notes app like Notion but better so its called Lotion
I have attached all the source file if you guys wanna tweak stuff and home some fun with it.
I have also deployed it as a website (Too broke to get servers tho) so yea go ahead and try it out.
